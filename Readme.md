# 💎 Diamond (Gemstone) Price Prediction

This project aims to accurately predict the price of gemstones (diamonds) using machine learning techniques. It follows a **modular, production-grade ML pipeline** structure, including best practices like logging, exception handling, and environment management using `conda`. The goal is to build a clean, scalable, and deployable price prediction system.

## 🧠 Model Training Workflow

* 📥 **Data Loading**: Loaded the `gemstone.csv` dataset using `pandas`.
* 🧹 **Data Cleaning**: Dropped unnecessary columns (e.g., `id`) to prepare the dataset.
* 🔄 **Preprocessing**: Applied data transformation (likely includes encoding, scaling — further confirmed in next cells).
* ✂️ **Feature Engineering**: Selected relevant features for modeling.
* 🧪 **Train-Test Split**: Divided data into training and testing sets to evaluate model generalization.
* 📈 **Model Building**: Trained regression models (such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or others).
* ✅ **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated model performance using metrics like R² Score, MAE, or RMSE.
* 💾 **Model Persistence**: Saved the trained model for future inference or deployment using `pickle` or `joblib`.
